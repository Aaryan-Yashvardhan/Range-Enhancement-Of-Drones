# Range-Enhancement-Of-Drones
This project utilized GNU Radio and ADALM Pluto SDR to experimentally enhance the communication range of drones by optimizing antenna performance through signal processing and synchronization techniques. We measured key metrics, including beamwidth at various frequencies, to evaluate the effectiveness of our enhancements.
